# Data Visualisation Lab 4

## World Statistics Visualiastion

### This visualisation is done using d3.js, the overall visualisation shows chloropleth maps, animated maps, bubble maps, bar graphs and scatter plots to see if there is a corralation between gender difference in countries and religion & education.

### Some people believe that religion has an effect on gender ratios in countries and some also believe that more education is also an influencial reason for unequal gender ratios.

### This visualisation shows whether they are right or wrong.

### The first section of the visualisation shows chloropleth maps on the population, population density and gender imbalance in countries. By clicking on the countries a bar chart will pop up showing more detailed visuals of the difference.

### The second section, shows stats on religions accross the world. The bubble map shows countries and the population of that country for each religion. This was an interesting way to compare countries population of religions. It can put into perspective the size differences. An example is indian hindus which was the largest bubble by a huge margin. The next religon visual is the animated map which shows how the  religions spreaded across the globe over the last few decades.

### The third section shows a scatter plot which comapares literacy vs gender ratios of the countries.
